title: Of the Ant and the Grasshopper


**FAB. XII. Of the Ant and Grashopper.** 

The King of _Antil_ and _Pismirian_ Lords,  
Each mounted on their own peculiar Hoards,  
Sate so distinguish’d Earls, Marqees, and Dukes:  
And not by Blazonrie in Heralds books,   
Where Worthy Sires produce less worthy Sons,   
Such as long Patience teach unwearied Duns,   
At base Mechanicks sawciness admire,   
Just Debts beseeching, Ruin'd by the Fire;   
Who scorn all Principles accounted Just,   
Indulging Sloth, Pride, Ignorance, and Lust:   
But these advanc'd by Industry and Care,   
Were to themselves both Ancestor and Heir,   
Their Purchase for th'insuing Winters store,   
Entitledd them to Honours less or more.  
  An Envoy from the _Grashoperian_ States,         
Thus had Conven'd these pettie Potentates,       
When to the Monarch and his small Devan,       
Thus humbly their Ambassador began.      
  Anthillian Soveraign, and Emetian Peers,   
Enrich'd with wealth from Ceres golden ears!   
Who in these Penetralia's under ground,   
Not hear rough Winter, flaws and Storms resound,   
Nor prices minding of rais'd Wood and Coals,   
Sit warm and feasting, cocker up your Souls:   
Live happy still, and be for ever blest,   
So you will pitty a poor State distrest;   
Who had while Summer lasted, plenteous Boards,   
Meads, Flowrie Vallies of their own accords,  
Serv'd up choice Cates,but when the Sun declin'd,  
And Days did up in shorter periods wind,  

Ushering cold blasts,and bleak Autumnal showers,   
Which Trees disrob'd of Leaves, Fields of their flowers,   
Winters approach threatning to Ruin all,   
Dicharg'd upon us Jove's cold Arsenal;   
All forage thus destroyd, all green below   
Left naked, Pennanc'd in cold sheets of Snow;   
All forts of Herbage, Fruits, whatever Corn,   
Are in by Peasants or your People born :   
Assistance from your Granaries we crave,   
Let not a Nation Perish, you may save,   
For which next Harvest, they will make return,   
Our Lusty Long-shanks shall help in your Corn:   
Thus grateful they propose to pay their Score,   
And double by their pains your next years Store.   
When the Antbilliam Heroe thus reply'd;   
In Summer we 'gainst Winter storms provide;   
How could you Golden Harvest idly spend?   
Could you believe those Joys would never end?   
Who thus return'd ; Sir, we were over-reach'd,   
By one to us New-fangled Doctrine teach'd,   
Holding forth, Phoebus our Protecor would   
Translate us from all Hunger, Thirst,and Cold   
To Ægypt,and the fruitful banks of Nile,   
To endless Feastings without Care or Toyl.   
So him we treated, and in Sunshine sung,   
Living as Merry as the day was long,   
Expeầing when a Western wind would rise,   
Should bear us to our promis'd Paradise;   
But when the time,and longd for hour was come,   
That we believ'd should be the (*) Day of Doom;  

(-) which Story in Grway, w ar
safet down in that Tr« wise con-
cerning the Lutherian War. Sleiden.

No Storm appear'd, no thick condensed Crack,  
With Thunder rose, Heavens Turrets to attack,   
But prov'd all Fair, so universal Cleer,  
That Day stands Crown'd the Glory of the Year;   
                                      Nor

Nor more our false Enthusiast webeheld,   
Who us to this sad Embassie compell'd.   
When thus the (b) King to the starv'd Envoy said  
We know no Manufacture, use no Trade,   
In Spring we Sowe not, nor in Winter Reap,   
Yet stuff'd our Granges are, our Markets cheap;   
Rather than we would Prince implore, or State,   
Or hang poor Clients at an Emperor's Gate,   
I, and my swarthy Legions should not spare,  
(c) Alcinous Fruit, but Camps revictual there,   
Hort-yards o'r-run, our bowells never yearn   
At havock måde, minding our own Concern,   
Choice Plants and Flowers destroy, we ne'r make halt,   
Unless we Scalding water feel, or Salt.    
  Say to your Lords, I not deplore their chance,   
You who in Summer Sung, in Winter Dance,   
So fill your bellies, so your bodies arm,   
'Gainst wants approaching, and th'infusing storm.   
Begon, who to Phanaticks credit give,   
Fifth-Monarcbie People I shall ne'r relieve;   
Boods, You term your Self a State Distrest,   
Antimonarchal Locust, I detest.  

Moral.   
Some always Feast, make Court, sing, play and Dance;  
And never fear the turns of fickle Chance :   
Provide for Age, whilft Young get Lands and Money;   
Lest Old and Poor, the Dogs do piss upon ye.
